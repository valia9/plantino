Plantino is an application that remembers the watering schedule of your houseplants for you.


As an owner of currently 17 plants (geraniums, strawberry, oleander and many more), I struggle to keep up with the schedule of the watering. Some applications have already been developed for this purpose (in fact, as a part of my research I have tried one and now use it daily). Nevertheless, the goal here was to practice my skills, especially when it comes to the backend. 


Plantino is a full-stack application built on the MERN stack. Initially, I intended to use an API but then, not succeeding in finding one that would fit my purpose, decided against it. Now it is a rather straightforward app which allows users to manually enter all the necessary information about their (house)plant: its name, the date when it was last watered, the number of days between each watering and notes on keeping it healthy and thriving. 


The application uses user authentication via Passport.js middleware that allows accessing the houseplants lists from everywhere.
